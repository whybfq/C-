 * A game, do A of the first CARDS on the table, B card on A playing card, two people play alternately, if someone hit the card the same as the one card on the table
* you can take both CARDS and the CARDS in the middle and put them at the end of your hand. When the CARDS in the hands of any one person are finished, the game is over and the opponent wins.
 * 小猫钓鱼游戏，A拿出手中的第一张扑克牌放到桌子上，B也出一张牌放到A打出的扑克牌上，两人交替出牌，若是某人打出的牌与桌子上的某张牌相同
 * 可将两张牌及其中间的牌全部取走，并依次放到自己手中牌的末尾。当任意一人手中的牌全部出完时，游戏结束，对手获胜。
