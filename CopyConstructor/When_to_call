#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A{
public:
    A(int i) {         //类型转换构造函数
        cout << "id = " <<  i << " IntConstructor called " << endl;
        id = i;
    }

    ~A() { cout << "id = " << id <<  " destructor called"  << endl;}
private:
    int id;
};

A d1(1);

void Func() {
    static A d2(2);
    A d3(3);
    cout <<  "func " << endl;
}


int main() {
    A d4(4);
    d4 = 6;
    cout << "Main "  << endl;
    { A d5(5); }
    Func();
    cout <<  "main ends " << endl;
    printf("");
    return 0;
}

Output:
id = 1 IntConstructor called 
id = 4 IntConstructor called 
id = 6 IntConstructor called 
id = 6 destructor called
Main 
id = 5 IntConstructor called 
id = 5 destructor called
id = 2 IntConstructor called 
id = 3 IntConstructor called 
func 
id = 3 destructor called
main ends 
id = 6 destructor called
id = 2 destructor called
id = 1 destructor called

Process finished with exit code 0
